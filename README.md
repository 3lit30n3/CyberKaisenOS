# CyberKaisenOS

CyberKaisenOS is an advanced cybersecurity system that combines offensive and defensive capabilities to provide comprehensive security solutions. Inspired by the anime "Jujutsu Kaisen," the system uses domain expansions and cursed techniques as metaphors for powerful cybersecurity tools and techniques.

## Phixeo Language: Our Competitive Edge

At the core of CyberKaisenOS is the revolutionary **Phixeo Language** - a multi-paradigm computational framework that transcends traditional programming approaches. Phixeo combines quantum computing principles, fractal mathematics, and sacred geometry to create security structures that are fundamentally superior to conventional systems.

Phixeo enables:
- **Quantum Execution Mode**: Security states that exist in superposition, making them impossible to observe without detection
- **Fractal Pattern Analysis**: Recursive vulnerability discovery that scales with complexity
- **Geometric Defense Structures**: Multi-dimensional security layers based on sacred geometry
- **Dimensional Layer Mapping**: Cross-dimensional security zones that protect across multiple attack vectors

## Features

### Offensive Capabilities
- **Social Media Brute Forcing**: Support for Gmail, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and OnlyFans with captcha handling and proxy rotation
- **OSINT Intelligence Gathering**: Advanced open-source intelligence gathering with custom wordlist generation
- **Vulnerability Discovery**: Automated vulnerability scanning and exploit development
- **Network Penetration**: Sophisticated network infiltration techniques
- **System Possession**: Ability to "possess" any host system via USB or network deployment

### Defensive Capabilities
- **Always-On Defense**: Like Gojo's Infinity in the anime, defenses are active at all times
- **Advanced Firewall System**: Multi-layered firewall protection with adaptive rule generation
- **Deception Networks**: Honeypots and shadow networks to detect and analyze attacks
- **Intrusion Detection/Prevention**: Real-time monitoring and response to security threats
- **Adaptive Defense**: Self-learning defense systems that adapt to new attack patterns
- **Kernel-Level Integration**: Deep system integration for maximum protection

### Core Components
- **Agents**: Specialized agents (Gojo, Sukuna, Toji, Maki) with unique capabilities
- **Domain Expansions**: Powerful security techniques that transform the digital environment
- **Virtualization**: VM-based security testing and isolation
- **AI Engine**: Machine learning for threat detection and analysis
- **Phixeo Kernel Module**: Low-level system integration for always-on protection

## Usage

### Installation
```bash
# Standard installation
sudo ./install_simple.sh

# Install with possession capability
sudo ./install_simple.sh --with-possession

# Install without kernel module (user-mode only)
sudo ./install_simple.sh --no-kernel
```

### Simple Command
```bash
# Run with default settings (Unlimited Void domain)
cyberkaisen

# Run with Malevolent Shrine domain
cyberkaisen -d shrine

# Run with Firewall Sanctuary domain
cyberkaisen -d sanctuary

# Run in interactive mode
cyberkaisen -i

# Possess another system (if installed with --with-possession)
cyberkaisen -p 192.168.1.100
```

### System Possession (Optional)
```bash
# Possess another system
cyberkaisen -p target_ip

# Create USB deployment package
sudo create-usb-deploy /path/to/usb
```

### Command Line Interface
```bash
# Boot the system
python cyberkaisen_cli.py boot

# Execute a domain expansion
python cyberkaisen_cli.py domain void

# Use an agent
python cyberkaisen_cli.py agent gojo scan

# Social media brute force
python cyberkaisen_cli.py agent sukuna social_brute_force --username target_user --platform instagram --wordlist wordlist.txt

# OSINT gathering
python cyberkaisen_cli.py agent toji gather_osint --target-name "John Smith" --generate-wordlist
```

### Always-On Defense
Once installed, CyberKaisenOS runs continuously in the background, providing always-on protection similar to Gojo's Infinity technique. The defense is active even when the interactive interface is not running.

## Philosophy

CyberKaisenOS demonstrates that the best defense requires understanding offensive capabilities at their highest level. By developing both offensive and defensive techniques to their fullest extent, we create a system that provides true security.

As the developers note: "The only defense against a system like this is to have a system like this."

## Phixeo Language Technical Details

The Phixeo Language operates across multiple execution modes, each with unique security implications:

### Quantum Mode
- Implements quantum circuit principles for security operations
- Creates entangled security states that cannot be observed without detection
- Uses superposition to maintain multiple security configurations simultaneously
- Example: `Unlimited Void` domain expansion uses quantum entanglement to create impenetrable security perimeters

### Fractal Mode
- Employs recursive patterns for vulnerability discovery and exploit development
- Scales attack and defense patterns across different complexity levels
- Self-similar structures that adapt to threat complexity
- Example: `Malevolent Shrine` uses fractal attack patterns that scale with threat intensity

### Geometric Mode
- Utilizes sacred geometry patterns for optimal defense structures
- Creates multi-dimensional security layers with cross-dimensional mapping
- Implements non-orientable topologies (Klein bottle, tesseract) for advanced packet inspection
- Example: `Firewall Sanctuary` uses sacred geometry to optimize defense coverage

### Dimensional Layers
- Creates n-dimensional security zones with configurable properties
- Maps between dimensions to protect across multiple attack vectors
- Enables cross-dimensional security operations
- Example: `Chimera Shadow Garden` uses dimensional mapping for traffic redirection
